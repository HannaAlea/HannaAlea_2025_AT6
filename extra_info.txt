The class UserInputValidator is created to group together methods that handle checking user input.

The method validate_positive_integers is defined inside the class.
The word "self" refers to the current object being used.
The parameter "items" is expected to be a list of strings entered by a user.

A short description (docstring) explains that the method accepts a list of strings and returns a list of valid positive integers.

An empty list named valid_numbers is created.
This list will store only the valid numbers that pass all checks.

A loop goes through each value in the items list one by one.
Each value is temporarily stored in the variable s.

The program checks if s contains only digits.
If the string contains anything else such as letters, spaces, or symbols, it is rejected.

If the string passes the digit check, it is converted from text into an integer.

The number is then checked to make sure it is greater than zero.
This removes zero and negative numbers.

If the number is valid, it is added to the valid_numbers list.

After all values have been checked, a message is shown to tell the user that validation is complete.

The method then returns the list of valid positive integers.

A second method named display_message is defined.
It takes one input, called message, and prints it to the screen.

This method is used to display a confirmation message after the validation process finishes.
